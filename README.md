P2P streaming in the browser.

This project is started to address the specific need of a reliable streaming platform, which can stream lectures, workshops etc. to a shifting number of participants.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a browser based (pure HTML5/JS), P2P (decentralized, distributed) streaming service, to be easily deployed and used.
